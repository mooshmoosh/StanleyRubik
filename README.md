One sentance description
------------------------
A javascript application for finding sequences of moves that can help a human solve a Rubix Cube of any particular size (i.e. 3x3x3 or 4x4x4 etc).

Applications
------------
Contrary to popular belief, solving a Rubix's Cube isn't quite as hard as it seems at first. There are plenty of YouTube videos that will teach you precise sequences of moves (called *algorithms*) and strategies for deciding which sequence to use. This software generates algorithms based on requirements such as:
 + only 4 pieces changed position
 + the second layer from the top is unchanged
